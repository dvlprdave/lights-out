### How to play

You're given a board of lights that toggle on/off. To win, you need to toggle all of the lights off. The catch is 
that whenever you click on a light cell, its surrounding cells will either light up or turn off. Click through to find 
the pattern and beat the game!

Tip: Corner light cells have fewer neighbors.
